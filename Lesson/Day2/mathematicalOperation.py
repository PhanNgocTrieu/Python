# Mathematic Operation
# Addition: + 
# Substraction : -
# Multiplication : *
# Divide : /
# power : **
# rule for workink priority: ---> () ** * / + -

# first: 3 * 3 = 9
# second: 3 / 3 = 1
# we have 9 + 1 - 3
# third: 9 + 1 
# lastly: 10 - 3
# => expect result: 7 (but we also have divide operation --> float number)
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)

# How can we get 3 from the uppon mathematic function 
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3) # --> expect output : 3.0
